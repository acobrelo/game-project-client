Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, provided back-end API through Ruby

Planning:
  The majority of the focus of my development was on the game logic itself.
  I gave myself the day before the assignment was due to focus on front end,
  as I knew I'd spend too much time on that if I started with it. Thus, my first
  day was spent making sure I knew vaguely what functionalities I wanted
  and setting up my main HTML and trying to incorporate a many basic elements
  as possible. Then from there, I focused pretty heavily on the API communication.
  I got the sign in functionality working pretty quickly early on so I could easily
  track my data and spent most of my time figuring out how to make sure all the
  nuances were addressed. The last two days were mainly spent polishing my logic
  and javascript, removing any console.logs, and then working a bit on the actual
  display. In the future, I want to improve at time-boxing because while I learned
  a lot, I felt myself rabbit holing and not realizing a lot of time had passed.
  All in all, it was pretty valuable.

  Logic-wise, a lot of the game logic is pretty redundant and based on saving variables
  and then calling them later, hiding a ton of elements, changing the html of divs,
  and basically being pretty direct in how I went about everything. While a lot of
  elements rely on others, I also tried to make it pretty easy to follow my logic,
  especially in functions that got a little convoluted. I tried to name variables pretty
  clearly and made sure to commit often.

Unsolved problems to fix in future iterations:
  Oh my where to begin. First, I'd want to absolutely fix the CSS. It breaks pretty
  easily and while it isn't buggy enough to be completely horrendous, it does bother
  me a lot because it was effectively thrown in as an after-thought. Also, I would want
  to go back through my code and make it wayyy more efficient. I was overly cautious
  and that spawned a ton of redundancy. Which is great because it works but at the same
  time, I'd really rather streamline it and not have 20 line methods hanging out.

User stories:
  a. As a user, I want to be able to make a move limited to free spaces so that the game continues as planned.
  b. As a user, I want the game to be able to keep track of the score so that I don't have to manually.
  c. As a user, I want to be able to select which character I am instead of having some sort of first-player advantage default.
  d. As a user I want to be able to log in and sign up to keep track of my score.
